 <!--    <h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Foundations of Data Science combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It also delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.</p> -->
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>CP 101 reserves seats for CED majors, as well as others from around campus (e.g., Data Science majors); others can enroll with the permission of the instructor. No prior statistics coursework is assumed. This class provides a foundation to pursue further undergraduate data science courses at UC-Berkeley. For Urban Studies CP 101 satisfies one of the four additional City Planning courses for Upper Division Urban Studies Core. For the City Planning minor, CP 101 satisfies one of the four additional City Planning courses for Upper Division courses under List 1. For SED, CP 101 can count as an Upper Division outside SED major for Fall 16 admits and later. Fall 15 and prior SED admits as well as Sustainable Design minor students can petition for it to fulfill a requirement.</p>


<h3>Course Requirements</h3>
<p>All computer assignments will involve the use of data and software available in or through the DCRP Computer Lab. We will be holding labs in a CED computer lab - lab computers use Windows’ operating system. You may use your personal computer in lab, if you’d like. We’ll be teaching labs for both PC and Mac users. If you are unfamiliar with either Windows or DCRP’s computer lab and want to use lab computers, you are encouraged to take advantage of the CED’s library services <a href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/environmental-design-library">(​Environmental Design Library Website​)</a> or consult with course instructors during office hours.</p>

<p>Students will be expected to have a working knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite - specifically Excel, PowerPoint, and Word - for this course. Students are welcome to explore the use of free, open software interfaces, such as the R language for statistical computing, the <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> software package; and the <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> project​; however, please check with the graduate student instructor before using any alternative software. Labs will be offered to introduce students to Excel, American FactFinder & Social Explorer, Carto, WordPress, and Python programming.</p>


<h3>Grading &amp; Assignments and Reading</h3>
<!-- <p>You are not alone in this course; the staff and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. For online questions, use <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2019/data8">Piazza</a>. We will also hold <a href="office-hours.html">office hours</a> for in-person discussions. Small-group tutoring sessions will be available for students in need of additional support to develop confidence with core concepts. In past semesters, students who attended have found these sessions to be a great use of their time. Details about sign-ups will be available later in the term</p> -->
<!-- <h3>Disclaimer</h3> -->
<p>Students will be expected to read a number of articles/chapters/etc. prior to lecture and lab sessions. For ten sessions, students are asked to submit responses online on our class bCourse site. Students will also be expected to attend and ​actively participate​ in class and lab.</p>
<p>They will take a midterm exam and complete three group projects, as well as a final presentation. Grades will be assigned as follows:</p>
<!-- <div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p><strong>Assignment 1 (Neighborhood Profile)</strong>: 20%</p>
<p><strong>Assignment 2 (Story Map)</strong>: 15%</p>

<h3>Reading Responses</h3>
<p>Students are expected to submit 10 short (200-250 word) responses to the readings online on the course bCourse site. Only the class sessions marked with a * are available for commentaries; these are the sessions with more theoretical or critical readings, rather than technical texts. The responses should not be simple summaries of the readings, but reactions to the concepts and analyses presented. Responses should be posted by midnight the day before class to the bCourses discussion thread for the lecture (e.g., February 24 for February 25 class).</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>All assignments will be conducted by groups of two students (though students may petition the instructor to expand the group to three). In the first two assignments (Neighborhood Profile and Story Map), students will explore the phenomenon of neighborhood change through in-depth analysis of census and economic data, as well as story-mapping. The Neighborhood Profile will be a Word document of 8-10 pages (1.5 spaces), plus appendices. The Story Map will consist of an interactive online map, with significant explanatory text.
<!-- </strong> Please check CalCentral to make sure you know when and where your lab is.</p> -->
<p>For the third assignment, students will explore a research question of their own choosing, using big data and/or open data portals, as well as analysis and visualization techniques learned in class. This deliverable should include both an online project and a narrative of 15-20 pages (1.5 spaces), including references in proper format. Students will submit a one-page description of their research question and approach in the beginning of April and work closely with the instructors to develop a methodological approach. The semester will culminate with short (8-10 minute) presentations of Assignment 3 (during reading week); this presentation is optional and will be for extra credit. </p>

<h3>Exam</h3>
<p>There will be a comprehensive midterm examination held after the second module to assess student learning of course topics. The exam will consist of two parts: an in-class quiz (definitions and short answers) based on the class readings and lectures, and an in-lab quiz, based on the lab exercises and assignments.</p>


<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend ​every​ class lecture and lab section. If for some compelling reason a student must miss a lesson or lab, they should alert the instructor ahead of time and may be asked to provide documentation of excuse after the fact. In addition to attending, students are expected to actively contribute to class discussions and ask questions. Participation will be evaluated by instructors based on a combination of attendance, and observed engagement and participation.</p>

<h3>Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Any test, paper or report submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own original work that has not previously been submitted for credit in another course. You may use words or ideas written by other individuals in publications, websites, or other sources, but <u>only with proper attribution​</u>. If you are not clear about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking an exam, be sure to ask a course instructor.</p>

<p>You should also keep in mind that as a member of the campus community you are expected to demonstrate integrity in all of your academic work and be evaluated on your own merits. The consequences of cheating and academic misconduct — including a formal discipline record and possible loss of future opportunities — are not worth the risks.</p>

<h3>Statement on Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have been issued a letter of accommodation from the ​<a href="https://dsp.berkeley.edu/">Disabled Students Program (DSP)​</a>, please see the course lead instructor as soon as possible to work out the necessary arrangements. If you need an accommodation and have not yet seen a Disability Specialist at the DSP, please do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you would need any assistance in the event of an emergency evacuation of the building, the DSP recommends that you make a plan for this in advance. (Contact the DSP access specialist at 643-6456.)</p>

<h3>Statement on Scheduling Conflicts</h3>
<p>Please notify course instructors by the second week of the term about any known or potential extracurricular conflicts (such as religious observances, graduate or medical school interviews, or team activities). We will try our best to help you with making accommodations, but cannot promise them in all cases.</p>





<!-- <p>In past semesters of Data 8, more than 40% of the students received grades in the A+/A/A- range and more than 35% received grades in the B+/B/B- range.</p>
<h3>Late Submission</h3>
<p>Late submissions of labs will not be accepted under any circumstances. The same goes for homework and projects, unless you have relevant university accommodations. If you have such accommodations, please provide the formal notification to your lab GSI before the end of the second week of classes.</p>
<p>Your two lowest homework scores and your lowest lab score will be dropped in the calculation of your overall grade. There will be no alternate due dates for assignments missed due to illness, other commitments, and so on. The drops are intended to cover those situations.</p>
<p>Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. </p>
<h3>Learning Cooperatively</h3>
<p>We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates as you are working on your weekly assignments. No matter what your academic background, you will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.</p>
<p>If some emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don't just disappear silently! You should inform your lab GSI and your project partner (if you have one) immediately, so that nobody is expecting you to do something you can't finish.</p>
<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>You must write your answers in your own words, and you must not share your completed work. The exception to this rule is that you can share everything related to a project with your project partner (if you have one) and turn in one project between the two of you.</p>
<p>Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the textbook and go over the lectures and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staff. That way you will get the most out of the discussion.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind the limits to collaboration. As noted above, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem solving. But you are not allowed to share your code or answers with other students. Doing so is academically dishonest, and it also doesn't help them: it just sets them up for trouble on the next assignment and on exams.</p>
<p>You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others. Not only is such copying dishonest, it misses the point of the assignments, which is not for you to find the answers somewhere and send them along to the staff. It is for you to figure out how to solve the problems, with the support available in the course.</p>
<p>Please read Berkeley's <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> carefully. Penalties for cheating in Data 8 are severe and include reporting to the <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct">Center for Student Conduct</a>. They might also include a F in the course or even dismissal from the university. It's just not worth it.</p>
<p>All you have to do is ask staff for help when you need it. You are not alone in Data 8! Instructors and staff are here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you.</p>
<h3>A Parting Thought</h3>
<p>The main goal of the course is that you should learn, and have a fantastic experience doing so. Please keep that goal in mind throughout the semester. Welcome to Data 8.</p> -->
