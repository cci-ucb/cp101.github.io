<!-- <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>CP 101 reserves seats for CED majors, as well as others from around campus (e.g., Data Science majors); others can enroll with the permission of the instructor. No prior statistics coursework is assumed. This class provides a foundation to pursue further undergraduate data science courses at UC-Berkeley. For Urban Studies CP 101 satisfies one of the four additional City Planning courses for Upper Division Urban Studies Core. For the City Planning minor, CP 101 satisfies one of the four additional City Planning courses for Upper Division courses under List 1. For SED, CP 101 can count as an Upper Division outside SED major for Fall 16 admits and later. Fall 15 and prior SED admits as well as Sustainable Design minor students can petition for it to fulfill a requirement.</p>


<h3>Course Requirements</h3>
<p>All computer assignments will involve the use of data and software available in or through the DCRP Computer Lab. We will be holding labs in a CED computer lab - lab computers use Windows’ operating system. You may use your personal computer in lab, if you’d like. We’ll be teaching labs for both PC and Mac users. If you are unfamiliar with either Windows or DCRP’s computer lab and want to use lab computers, you are encouraged to take advantage of the CED’s library services <a href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/environmental-design-library">(​Environmental Design Library Website​)</a> or consult with course instructors during office hours.</p>

<p>Students will be expected to have a working knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite - specifically Excel, PowerPoint, and Word - for this course. Students are welcome to explore the use of free, open software interfaces, such as the R language for statistical computing, the <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> software package; and the <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> project​; however, please check with the graduate student instructor before using any alternative software. Labs will be offered to introduce students to Excel, American FactFinder & Social Explorer, Carto, WordPress, and Python programming.</p>


<h3>Grading &amp; Assignments and Reading</h3>

<p>Students will be expected to read a number of articles/chapters/etc. prior to lecture and lab sessions. For ten sessions, students are asked to submit responses online on our class bCourse site. Students will also be expected to attend and ​actively participate​ in class and lab.</p>
<p>They will take a midterm exam and complete three group projects, as well as a final presentation. Grades will be assigned as follows:</p>

<!-- <h3>Reading Responses</h3>
<p>Students are expected to submit 10 short (200-250 word) responses to the readings online on the course bCourse site. Only the class sessions marked with a * are available for commentaries; these are the sessions with more theoretical or critical readings, rather than technical texts. The responses should not be simple summaries of the readings, but reactions to the concepts and analyses presented. Responses should be posted by midnight the day before class to the bCourses discussion thread for the lecture (e.g., February 24 for February 25 class).</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>All assignments will be conducted by groups of two students (though students may petition the instructor to expand the group to three). In the first two assignments (Neighborhood Profile and Story Map), students will explore the phenomenon of neighborhood change through in-depth analysis of census and economic data, as well as story-mapping. The Neighborhood Profile will be a Word document of 8-10 pages (1.5 spaces), plus appendices. The Story Map will consist of an interactive online map, with significant explanatory text.
</strong> Please check CalCentral to make sure you know when and where your lab is.</p> -->
<!-- <p>For the third assignment, students will explore a research question of their own choosing, using big data and/or open data portals, as well as analysis and visualization techniques learned in class. This deliverable should include both an online project and a narrative of 15-20 pages (1.5 spaces), including references in proper format. Students will submit a one-page description of their research question and approach in the beginning of April and work closely with the instructors to develop a methodological approach. The semester will culminate with short (8-10 minute) presentations of Assignment 3 (during reading week); this presentation is optional and will be for extra credit. </p>

<h3>Exam</h3>
<p>There will be a comprehensive midterm examination held after the second module to assess student learning of course topics. The exam will consist of two parts: an in-class quiz (definitions and short answers) based on the class readings and lectures, and an in-lab quiz, based on the lab exercises and assignments.</p>


<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend ​every​ class lecture and lab section. If for some compelling reason a student must miss a lesson or lab, they should alert the instructor ahead of time and may be asked to provide documentation of excuse after the fact. In addition to attending, students are expected to actively contribute to class discussions and ask questions. Participation will be evaluated by instructors based on a combination of attendance, and observed engagement and participation.</p>

<h3>Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Any test, paper or report submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own original work that has not previously been submitted for credit in another course. You may use words or ideas written by other individuals in publications, websites, or other sources, but <u>only with proper attribution​</u>. If you are not clear about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking an exam, be sure to ask a course instructor.</p>

<p>You should also keep in mind that as a member of the campus community you are expected to demonstrate integrity in all of your academic work and be evaluated on your own merits. The consequences of cheating and academic misconduct — including a formal discipline record and possible loss of future opportunities — are not worth the risks.</p>

<h3>Statement on Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have been issued a letter of accommodation from the ​<a href="https://dsp.berkeley.edu/">Disabled Students Program (DSP)​</a>, please see the course lead instructor as soon as possible to work out the necessary arrangements. If you need an accommodation and have not yet seen a Disability Specialist at the DSP, please do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you would need any assistance in the event of an emergency evacuation of the building, the DSP recommends that you make a plan for this in advance. (Contact the DSP access specialist at 643-6456.)</p>

<h3>Statement on Scheduling Conflicts</h3>
<p>Please notify course instructors by the second week of the term about any known or potential extracurricular conflicts (such as religious observances, graduate or medical school interviews, or team activities). We will try our best to help you with making accommodations, but cannot promise them in all cases.</p>
