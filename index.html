<h3> Course Description</h3>
This course (1) provides a basic intro to census and economic data collection, processing, and analysis; (2) explores visualization and story mapping techniques in planning; (3) teaches methods of urban analytics; and (4) provides a socio-economic-political context for the urban analytics movement, focusing on data ethics and governance.

<h3> Synopsis</h3>
CP 101 introduces students to the systematic analysis of urban data in its institutional context. Recognizing that defining this context relies on critical thinking with regard to economic, social, and environmental outcomes, this course explores how stakeholders conceptualize “smart” and inclusive urbanity. Accordingly, this course teaches students systematic approaches to collecting, analyzing, modeling, and interpreting quantitative and qualitative data used to inform robust research, and, ultimately, urban planning practice and policymaking. Beyond instruction in urban data science and analytics, students will be introduced to theory and critical discourses on topics such as big data, open data and e-governance. Instructors will expect students to engage with technical and theoretical - with particular focus placed on ethical - considerations associated with these subjects in lecture and laboratory sections. The course will introduce students to programming in Excel and Python, using open source software, accessing open and scraped data, and other tools and techniques for urban analysis.
<p></p>
The course will be structured following three (3) modules:

<h3>Module 1: Introduction to Urban Data</h3>
During this module students will be introduced to fundamental data applications and ethical dilemmas in urban planning. They will be instructed on sourcing data, analyzing data via statistical testing, and presenting data through written reports and visualizations. In Module 1, students will gain skills in working with Census and economic data, statistical testing, and static data visualization. The deliverable for this module will be a descriptive profile of a Bay Area neighborhood.

<p></p>

<h3> Module 2: Mapping the City</h3>
In the course’s second module, students will learn different tools to make maps. We will gain an understanding of the basic elements of maps, how to map with online programs and geographic information systems software (Carto), and how to construct story map websites. Students will produce a story map as the product for this module.

<p></p>

<h3> Module 3: Data Science for Planners: Big Data and Analytics</h3>
In the course’s final module, students will use knowledge acquired in earlier modules to explore urban data science techniques. Classes will cover topics such as big data, open data, volunteered geographic information, smart cities, and civic hacking; and students will gain skills in real-time and crowd-sourced data collection and use. As the final project for the class, students will use novel sources of data to answer a research question of their choice. 
<p></p>

<h3> Testimonials </h3>
<i> "I just wanted to reach out to thank you for an amazing semester for CP 101. Since I will be a rising senior, I was looking for some courses to take this semester that seemed interesting to take, regardless of credits or major requirements, and I am so lucky that I stumbled upon this class. To be honest, being a data science major with no background in urban planning, I was actually quite intimidated in the beginning of the course, as I was unsure if I would be able to follow along with all the new materials, as well as using tools that I had never used before, such as Carto. My only regret is that I wish I would have taken this course sooner because then I would have applied for the City Planning minor! </i>
<p></p>
<i> I've always enjoyed the interdisciplinary nature of data science, and really enjoyed how this class allowed me to use my analytical skills to delve into social issues. In many of my other classes such as Data 8 or even Data 100, all projects were outlined and given to us, so I appreciated how we got to choose our own prompts and collect the data ourselves for Assignment 2 and 3. Additionally, I also appreciated the guest speakers that we had that were able to showcase how what we were learning in class could be applied to the real world" </i> Junior in Data Science
<br>
<br> 
        
<p></p>   
<i>"Despite the uncertain and tumultuous times, your course was invaluable and enriching, especially as an Urban Studies student interested in data science but too intimidated by STEM courses. At first, I was reluctant to take the class because I feared it being too difficult for someone more policy-oriented and analytical. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by its comprehensive perspective on topics and softwares that I would have never otherwise learned but are nonetheless important" </i> - Junior in Urban Studies
<br>
<br> 
       
<p></p>  
<i>"I have enjoyed all of your classes immensely and had a great time learning about city planning in my first ever CYPLAN class. Thank you so much for all of your encouraging comments and guidance, I was able to explore new ideas and form new perspectives on the field. I actually plan on pursuing a Masters in City Planning after I graduate and this class has been invaluable to my understanding of the field, as well as the directions this field is going to in the future. You have all inspired me to expand my horizons and explore how data science, urban design (architecture) and city planning can work together to achieve happier and more efficient cities"</i> - Junior in Architecture      
<br>

<p></p> 
<i> " I just wanted to write to both of you to thank you for providing such an amazing course. While that was pressured by a number of circumstances, as well as technical constraints/struggle on my end, I truly valued the process of learning and manipulating data to a new degree. I never saw myself wanting to explore data, but for some reason that has all changed" </i> - Junior in Urban Studies
