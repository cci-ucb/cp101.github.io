The website provides a number of color options for whatever kind of visual you are providing, and can be useful if you are thinking of presenting your tables (and later maps) to a wider audience. You can then use the information to manually adjust the colors for your visual. It can take a little time, so I would recommend finalizing your visual first and then doing color adjustments as the last step."
